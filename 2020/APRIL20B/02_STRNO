Strange Number

When Varsha was travelling home, she saw a mysterious villa. Varsha is curious about this strange villa and wants to explore it. When she reached the entry gate, the guard gave her a problem to solve and said that he would allow her to enter the villa only if she solved it.

The guard gave Varsha two integers X and K. Varsha needs to determine whether there is an integer A such that it has exactly X positive integer divisors and exactly K of them are prime numbers.

Varsha found this problem really hard to solve. Can you help her?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer: 1 if a valid integer A exists or 0 if it does not exist.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤X,K≤109
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points):

T≤100
K≤2
Subtask #2 (85 points): original constraints

Example Input
1
4 2
Example Output
1
Explanation
Example case 1: A=6 has X=4 factors: 1, 2, 3 and 6. It also has exactly K=2 prime factors: 2 and 3.
